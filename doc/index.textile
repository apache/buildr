title: Apache Buildr
---

Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and tools.  We wanted something that's simple and intuitive to use, so we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.  But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with a language that's a joy to use.  And of course, we wanted it to be fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.


h2(#why).  Why Buildr Rocks

"Daniel Spiewak":http://www.codecommit.com/blog:

bq. If you think about it, the question isn’t “Why use Buildr?”, it’s really “Why use anything else?” The advantages afforded by Buildr are so substantial, I really can’t see myself going with any other tool, at least not when I have a choice.

"Tristan Juricek":http://tristanhunt.com/:

bq. That’s still the strongest sell: it builds everything I need, and as I’ve needed more, I just got things working without a lot of fuss.

"Matthieu Riou":http://offthelip.org/:

bq. We used to rely on Ant, with a fairly extensive set of scripts. It worked but was expensive to maintain. The biggest mistake afterward was to migrate to Maven2. I could write pages of rants explaining all the problems we ran into and we still ended up with thousands of lines of XML.

"Martin Grotzke":http://www.javakaffee.de/blog/:

bq. The positive side effect for me as a java user is that I learn a little ruby, and that’s easy but lots of fun… :-)

"Ijonas Kisselbach":http://twitter.com/ijonas/statuses/4134103928:

bq. I've cleaned up & migrated the Vamosa build process from 768 lines of Ant build.xml to 28 lines of Buildr.

h2(#what).  What You Get

* A simple way to specify projects, and build large projects out of smaller sub-projects.
* Pre-canned tasks that require the least amount of configuration, keeping the build script DRY and simple.
* Compiling, copying and filtering resources, JUnit/TestNG test cases, APT source code generation, Javadoc and more.
* A dependency mechanism that only builds what has changed since the last release.
* A drop-in replacement for Maven 2.0, Buildr uses the same file layout, artifact specifications, local and remote repositories.
* All your Ant tasks are belong to us! Anything you can do with Ant, you can do with Buildr.
* No overhead for building "plugins" or configuration. Just write new tasks or functions.
* Buildr is Ruby all the way down.  No one-off task is too demanding when you write code using variables, functions and objects.
* Simple way to upgrade to new versions.
* Did we mention fast?

So let's get started.  You can "read the documentation online":quick_start.html, or "download the PDF":buildr.pdf.


h2(#news).  What's New

Highlights from Buildr 1.4.24 (2016-03-15)
* Added:  Support the :no_invoke parameter being passed to Buildr.project() and
          Buildr.projects() to avoid attempting to call invoke when retrieving the projects.
* Added:  Add `exclude_paths` setting to pmd addon to allow paths to be explicitly excluded.
* Fixed:  Update jDepend addon to ensure target directories are invoked prior to attempting
          to analyze directories.
* Added:  Add jdepend.additional_project_names configuration to jDepend addon to
          ease merging in the source paths from multiple projects into one jDepend task.
* Added:  Add findbugs.additional_project_names configuration to Findbugs addon to
          ease merging in the source paths from multiple projects into one Findbugs task.
* Added:  Add checkstyle.additional_project_names configuration to Checkstyle addon to
          ease merging in the source paths from multiple projects into one Checkstyle task.
* Added:  Add pmd.additional_project_names configuration to PMD addon to ease merging in
          the source paths from multiple projects into one PMD task.
* Change: Update the default GWT version used in the GWT addon to the latest release 2.7.0.
* Change: Update the checkstyle addon to use checkstyle 6.12.1.
