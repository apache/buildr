    <shortdesc>Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and tools.</shortdesc>
    <description>We wanted something that's simple and intuitive to use, so we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.  But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with a language that's a joy to use.</description>

          by Dieter Vrancken.

* Change: BUILDR-705 - Avoid attempting to load rspec classes unless Buildr.rspec_present?
          returns true. Reported By rbpandey.

* Change: BUILDR-704 - Updated the Sonar addon to support the latest version of SonarQube
          Runner. Submitted by Ross Mahony.
* Added:  Add support for ipr.add_glassfish_remote_configuration method that generates
          a remote glassfish configuration in IntelliJ IDEA project files.
* Added:  Add support for iml.prefix and ipr.prefix settings that prefix the generated
          IntelliJ IDEA project and module files.
* Change: Update the buildr gemspec so that rspec is no longer a required dependency.
          This enables end-users to use a different version of rspec and buildr in
          the same project. The rspec version MUST be be compatible with the version
          used by Buildr if rspec features are used from within Buildr. Buildr also
          issues a warning if the `check` method is called and rspec has not been loaded.
          The warning includes directions on how to resolve the issue. Submitted by r6p.
* Fixed:  A long standing bug existed such that if tests failed to compile, and the
          option Buildr.options.test is set to :all then the compilation error would
          not result in a failed build. As many people set the Buildr.options.test to
          :all in their continuous delivery/integration tools, this has caused some
          problems. This has been fixed by ensuring all the problems associated with
          the resolving the prerequisites are not caught when Buildr.options.test is
          set to :all.
* Change: Update checkstyle to 6.1.1. Submitted by neher.
* Fixed:  Avoid empty dependency issue in gwt addon if the attempting to gwt compile
          a project that has no src/main/java.
* Fixed:  Support dependencies in the gwt addon that are other local projects rather
          that artifacts, without forcing a compilation of dependency when parsing
          buildfile.
* Added:  Support configuration of sql dialect mapping in IDEA generated project files
          through methods on the ipr extension ipr.mssql_dialect_mapping,
          ipr.postgres_dialect_mapping and ipr.sql_dialect_mappings
* Added:  Support specification of the target project to which the gwt compilation
          artifacts are added as an asset, by using :target_project option.

* Fixed:  Change the name of the GlassFish install in ipr.add_glassfish_configuration
          to use the same convention that IDEA uses by default. i.e. Name the
          installation "GlassFish 4.1.0" rather than "Glassfish 4.1.0".

* Added:  Support a single intermediate directory for each project hierarchy
          through an addon 'buildr/single_intermediate_layout'.
* Fixed:  BUILDR-660 possible build issue when using build.yaml and tasks/*.rake
          (Félix Enrique Llorente Pastora)
* Added:  Support the :dir option in the Java::Commands.java method.
* Fixed:  Scala 2.10 support - compiler now uses additional/separate jars
          introduced in 2.10 such as scala-reflect.jar and scala-actor.jar
* Added:  Add an addon for NSIS.
* Change: BUILDR-612 - Support the TestNG 6.x versions and default
          to 6.8.
* Added:  BUILDR-599 - Support the passing of arguments to testng
          test runner.
* Fixed:  Observer the per-project source version when generating
          IDEA module files.
* Change: Sort the components in IDEA project files in the same
          order the idea sorts them.
* Fixed:  Findbugs addon correctly handles String dependencies
          (vs task dependencies)
* Fixed:  Checkstyle addon correctly handles String dependencies
          (vs task dependencies)
* Added:  Created an addon 'buildr/wsgen' for generating wsdls from java
          and java from wsdls using the underlying wsgen tool.
* Change: Defer the expansion of generated poms by wrapping the generation
          in a Proc.
* Change: Rework Artifact.content(value) method to accept a Proc that
          will be called before the artifact is written rather than
          requiring a string.
* Added:  Create a 'buildr/gpg' addon that signs and uploads signatures
          when uploading artifacts. Inspired by a similar extension in
          the Apache ODE project by Tammo van Lessen.
* Change: Updated dependency versions;
          - jruby-openssl (0.8.2)
          - atoulme-Antwrap (0.7.4)
* Change: Require 'bundler/setup' as part of buildr startup to ensure that
          buildr always runs with up to date dependencies if a Gemfile is
          present.
* Added:  Add FrameworkDetectionExcludesConfiguration facet to Idea project
          file creation by default.
* Fixed:  In the IntelliJ extension, defer the materialization of the
          default_components until expansion time to avoid loss of sub-
          components added after an add_component call.
* Fixed:  BUILDR-633 - Remove hardcoded shebang lines in all-in-one release.
* Added:  Create a simple extension that modifies the project layout to place
          generated files at the top level.

* Fixed:  Fixed the interaction with the FileUtils classes. The last release
          introduced a non-deterministic bug that sometimes caused logging
          preferences to be ignored and the install method to be
          inadvertently overwritten.
