    <shortdesc>Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and tools.</shortdesc>
    <description>We wanted something that's simple and intuitive to use, so we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.  But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with a language that's a joy to use.</description>

          (Félix Enrique Llorente Pastora)
* Added:  Support the :dir option in the Java::Commands.java method.

          requiring a string.

          when uploading artifacts. Inspired by a similar extension in
          the Apache ODE project by Tammo van Lessen.

          file creation by default.
